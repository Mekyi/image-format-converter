# Image format converter

My old archived Python script that is used to convert `.avif` and `.webp` image formats into `.gif` format.

I like to use emotes from Twitch and its extensions in Discord and since Discord does not support those file formats, I needed an easy and quick way to make them usable.

Script was originally made only for my own use but the goal is to make a small project out of this.

## TODO

- [ ] Python venv
- [ ] Support more input and output formats
- [ ] Graphical UI
- [ ] Settings/parameters
